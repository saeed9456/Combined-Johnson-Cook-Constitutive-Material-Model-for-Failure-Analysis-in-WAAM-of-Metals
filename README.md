# Combined-Johnson-Cook-Constitutive-Material-Model-for-Failure-Analysis-in-WAAM-of-Metals
This user UMAT user subroutine implements a material model in Abaqus which predicts residual stress distribution, warpage, and deformation throughout the wire arc additive manufacturing metals. It integrates the Johnson-Cook material model with Von Mises failure model to predict the stress and diformation buildup during the WAAM process.
